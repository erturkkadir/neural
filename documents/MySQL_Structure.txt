1. We have neuron table to hold neuron information
	nr_x, nr_y, nr_z (neuron coordinate in 3D space)
 	nr_shiftr, nr_shifti (bias in complex plane)
	nr_outr, nr_outi (neuron outputs in t)
	nr_type : neuron type (input, hidden, output)
	nr_status : wheter this neuron is excited or not
		if it is excited, calculate in forward pass
	nr_train : there is a potential needs to be backpropageded

2. weight table hold information about connections between neurons
	fromx_fromy, fromz (connection from)
	to_x, to_y, to_z : (connected to )
	we_real, we_imag : real, image part of weight

both tables are indexed properly to access and update as fast as possible. 

The cost is insertion and deletion and we plan to use it few times


Stored Procedures
	createnn : This procedure creates a neural network with a hiven parameters
	px, py, pz : Network size in respective direction
	inp_width: The width of input layer, it usually represent sensor input locations
	cen_width: Centreal block width, it may be output of system, or a motor nuerons
	Example 
		call createnn(10,10,10,1,5);
	creates a network with 10x10x10 dimentsion,
	The surface of cube is assigned as input layer and creates 5x5x5 output layer cubes in the core.

	createwei : Creates weighh map from neurons to neurons and assigne random number
	px, py, pz : Network size in respective direction, thta number has to match with px,py,pz in createnn
	d_x, d_y, d_z : How far a connection can go in deep in respective direction 	 
	There is 2 other parameters that user can change,
		n_min, n_max : How many connections this particular neuron can have (Ex : 10-20)
	
	forward : Calculate forward pass of network,
		1. The query first finds out all neuron that arew excited by nr_status=1 condition Ne
		2. Then finds all neuron that are connected those layer in step 1 Nc	
		3. Find out all neurons that are connected Nc and nr_status = 1 (excited) Ns
		4. Multiply the output of all Ns by related connection(Ns to Nc) and sum them up Nt
		5. Apply sigmoid functions to set the output of Ne and make nr_status=1 for next step
		6. goto process 1

	formard outputs one parameter only which indicate the result of process
	Example : 	call forward(@res)
			select @res;
			commit;
